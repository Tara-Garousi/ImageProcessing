# Mastering OpenCV with Python

This repository contains the code examples from the book **Mastering OpenCV with Python: Use NumPy, Scikit, TensorFlow, and Matplotlib to Learn Advanced Algorithms for Machine Learning** (2023, Orange Education Pvt Ltd, AVAâ„¢). The code is designed to help you master computer vision and image processing techniques using Python, building on fundamental algorithms and exploring their applications in real-world scenarios.

## Repository Structure

The code is organized into folders, each corresponding to a chapter from the book. Every chapter includes:
- **Examples**: Practical, well-commented Python code implementations that demonstrate key concepts.
- **Explanations**: Clear and concise explanations of the code and algorithms, providing context to help you understand how the techniques work and can be applied.
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter Notebooks are provided where applicable for step-by-step interactive learning.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:leila4793/ImageProcessing.git
   ```

2. **Navigate** to the folder corresponding to the chapter you want to explore:
   ```bash
   cd Chapter_01
   ```

3. **Run the Python scripts** or Jupyter Notebooks to see the code in action:
   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   # or if using Jupyter Notebooks
   jupyter notebook script_name.ipynb
   ```

4. **Customize and Experiment**: Feel free to modify the code to experiment with different parameters or integrate it into your own projects.
